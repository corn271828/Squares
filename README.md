# Squares
A simple game/


Instructions:
Game mechanics should be obvious. Move with WASD or arrow keys.

For some reason the jspinner grabs the focus when the game starts; just double click on the game panel and it should work.

Hotkeys: 

R - restart level

P - toggle practice mode (100 lives) (requires restart)

K - skip level

T - activates autoplay (boss level only) (doesn't work right now don't try it)

C - adds a checkpoint in practice mode (boss level only) (possibly works?)

V - removes last checkpoint (boss level only)

B - clears all checkpoints (boss level only)
